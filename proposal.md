## Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!)

- [ ] Blackjack

## Project Description

My app is called Blackjack. Players face an AI dealer in a classic game of Blackjack, coded according to the real sequence of play at a casino (cards are dealt, player hits until they choose to stand (or regrettably bust). Player Win, Dealer Win, Push, and Bust scenarios will all been accounted for. Users will have the option to play as many rounds as they'd like. In the future, I'd like to add a more polished UI.

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to recognize every possible win/loss conditon of Blackjack (win, loss, push, bust).
- As a player, I would like to be informed when the hand is over.

- As a player, I would like to know whose turn it is so that I don't have to keep track.
- As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a win, loss or tie.
- As a player, I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals
